    <string name="about">FaithBuilders™ is a Northwest spiritual growth workshop for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ to be full grown in service to Christ. Our goal is to reach, not only the Northwest Churches of Christ, but all corners of the brotherhood.\n\nOur theme is found in Ephesians 4:14–16 – “Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head that is Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.”\n\nWe seek to help churches and individual members to seek to return back to the Scriptures and align ourselves with the divine pattern of New Testament Christianity.\n\nThe next FaithBuilders™ workshop is scheduled on July 7–9, 2016 and is held at the Pacific Lutheran University. It will take place in the beautifully remodeled Eastvold Auditorium on campus.\n\nThis university has gracefully and enthusiastically allowed us to use their facilities understanding that we have different doctrinal positions from the Lutherans, but have accepted us as paying customers of their facilities.\n\nThis workshop is being overseen by two elderships and their congregations: The Springbrook Church of Christ in Renton, Washington and the Puyallup Church of Christ in Puyallup, Washington. Ken Wilson is the director. Our purpose is to make this workshop a yearly event for as long as the Lord allows.\n\nWe are expecting an attendance of at least 500 or more and hope to build on that for the next few years.</string>
